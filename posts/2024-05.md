## Neurosift: DANDI exploration and NWB visualization in the browser: JOSS paper

2024-05-27

Today we [published a paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.06590) in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) describing Neurosift.

JOSS reviews are open and transparent. Feel free to check out the [review thread](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/6590).

**Abstract:** Neurosift, a browser-based visualization tool, is designed for the interactive exploration of Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files, whether stored locally, on remote servers, or within the Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI). NWB (Rübel et al., 2022; Teeters et al., 2015) is an open data standard for neurophysiology that enables the sharing, archiving, and analysis of various types of neurophysiology data. DANDI (Rübel et al., 2022) is a cloud-based platform that supports the storage, sharing, and analysis of neurophysiology data including NWB files. With Neurosift integration, users browsing DANDI can easily open any NWB file in the browser and explore its contents, including timeseries data, images, and more. Neurosift can also be used to browse the DANDI database or individual Dandisets. Overall, Neurosift simplifies the visualization and exploration of complex NWB file structures, making it a valuable tool for neuroscientists.
