## Interactive neurosift views embedded in a document: Dandiset 000473

2024-12-02

I’ve created a new interactive page for **Dandiset 000473**: [https://figurl.github.io/dandiset-000473](https://figurl.github.io/dandiset-000473). It’s designed to showcase Neurosift widgets embedded in a markdown document.

The document features **zoomable spike density plots** and a units table for each session. These plots are built using multiscale arrays for smooth rendering, even when zooming in to explore spike structure. You can also toggle Rastermap ordering of units and view units tables directly on the page. For sessions with behavioral data, those details are integrated as well. Clicking on a session will take you to the full Neurosift view for deeper exploration.
